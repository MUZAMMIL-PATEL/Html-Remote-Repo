            <div class="text"><h5>INFORMATION ABOUT HAYABUSA 2021</h5>The 2021 Suzuki Hayabusa has made a lot of improvements to the engine and other parts of the bike, with upgrading as a constant goal. This model is being advertised as having made some improvements over the previous one. That said, Suzuki has abandoned their plans to start over from scratch and use a chassis and design from an older model as the basis for their 2021 Suzuki Hayabusa.

                The second-generation model of Hayabusa from five years earlier, now defunct, will be the basis for modification for the 2021 model. While it will retain the twin-spar aluminum frame, it will be heavily modified, and now, as a result, it will have the newest Kayaba suspension system.
                
                The engine also retains aspects from the previous iteration, but with a larger displacement. This is a frequently-used method to comply with stricter emission standards in Europe without having to sacrifice power. The engine will be a four-cylinder with a liquid-cooled motor and an output of 200 horsepower. The increased engine displacement combined with the newer chassis may likely result in weight reduction.</div>
